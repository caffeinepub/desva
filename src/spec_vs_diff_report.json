However, several requirements cannot be confirmed or appear not to match the spec exactly (notably exact text formatting for prices/descriptions and required generated icon assets). The diff also introduces unrequested Internet Identity/auth scaffolding and an extra caffeine.ai attribution link in the footer.",
